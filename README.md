# Ombori React Code Test

What the test app should do:

* Display a custom loading component for 3 seconds
* Fetch user data from https://reqres.in/
* Display those users in a scrollable view that lazy loads more users when you've reached the bottom of the list, if there are no more users to load it should indicate that there are no more users.
* Be responsive, look great and work well on different devices, especially various mobile screens
